              Laughter flows down the stairs as the captain of the watch raises
              his mug. He addresses the baker's dozen of guards that are
              gathered in the hall, "Tonight we shall feast like kings! The
              dowry this month was especially fruitful!" He closes his eyes,
              bellowing another battery of laughter as the torches in the room
              flicker out for what could only been a split second. The captain
              composes himself and his laughter quickly fades as his eyes reopen
              to the eerily silent room. Thirteen corpses, all dead before they
              hit the ground, lie in an ocean of blood. Little does he know that
              he is about to join them, as a bloody dagger comes out from the
              mans own shadow, followed by a sinister smile.

              Shadowmancers have dedicated themselves to the art of manipulating
              shadows, even becoming one with them. They are often high profile
              assassins or infiltrators. Their skills allow them to often deal
              decisive blows that completely change the tide of battle.If you
              are ever going into combat underground or in low light conditions,
              there is few allies you should rather have by your side.

              another. As a bonus action you can teleport up to 10 feet to an
              unoccupied space you can see that is either a shadow, or in dim
              light or darkness.

            <p>
              Starting at 3rd level, you have learned to unleash a needle sharp
              spike from the shadows. You may use your Action to make a ranged
              spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of a shadow you can
              see within 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your
              Dexterity modifier to its attack rolls, but
              <span class="bold">NOT</span> the damage rolls. A creature hit by
              this attack takes necrotic damage equal to your Sneak Attack. You
              may split the spike apart into as many die as you roll for Sneak
              Attack damage, you may choose an individual target for each spike
              but they must all originate from the same shadow.

            <h3 class="heading ability">Umbral Cloak</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 9th level, you have learned to become one with the
              shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can
              use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until
              you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright
              light.

            <h3 class="heading ability">Shadow Puppet</h3>
            <p>
              By 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with their
              shadows. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a
              creature within 30 feet you, their shadow seems to come alive and
              move on its own. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls
              against that creature until the end of the turn.

            <h3 class="heading ability">Manifest Shadow</h3>
            <p>
              When you reach 17th level, you can use a bonus action to magically
              manifest a shadow of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see
              within 15 feet of you. This shadow is a magical, opaque, black
              image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss
              it as a bonus action, until you manifest another shadow, or until
              you're incapacitated.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
              Your shadow has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and
              immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it
              uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as
              you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally
              command the shadow to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no
              action required). If your shadow is ever more than 30 feet from
              you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">You can use the shadow in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places
                with your shadow at a cost of 15 feet of your movement,
                regardless of the distance between the two of you.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you
                make with that action can originate from your space or the
                shadow's space. You make this choice for each attack.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your shadow
                moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to
                make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were
                in the shadow's space.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">
              <span class="bold">20th level:</span> You can use a bonus action
              to create two shadows with your Manifest Shadow feature, and these
              shadows can coexist. If you try to create a third shadow, the
              previous two shadows are destroyed. Anything you can do from one
              shadow's position can be done from the other's instead.
